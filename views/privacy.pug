    p These pages were created by Dave from Libraries Hacked. You can #[a(href="mailto:info@librarieshacked.org") email me] with any questions.

    h3 GitHub pages

    p This site is hosted using #[a(href="https://pages.github.com/") GitHub pages]. Although we don't store any personal data it is important to be aware that website hosting providers can also log web traffic that could include information such as your IP address.

    p GitHub has its own #[a(href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement") privacy statement]. The majority of this is about unrelated logged-in services within GitHub, but there is a reference to GitHub pages. Along with advising that GitHub pages sites should have their own privacy policy (e.g. this one), it says that logs of visitor IP addresses can be used for security purposes. A quote of this is displayed below, but a maintained version will be on the GitHub site.

    blockquote “Please note that GitHub may collect Technical Information from visitors to your GitHub Pages website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to maintain the security and integrity of the website and service.”

    h3 Tracking and analytics

    p The site uses a software platform called Umami for website analytics. Umami is an open-source, self-hosted (hosted by Libraries Hacked) analytics solution that does not use cookies or collect personally identifiable information.

    h3 Postcode search

    p The main search page optionally includes a postcode in order to prioritise library services close to the entered postcode.

    p A postcode can be personally identifiable information. The postcode you enter is not stored, either in this site, or in the postcode service used to perform the lookup. This uses another Libraries Hacked service, the #[a(href="https://github.com/LibrariesHacked/api-geography") Geography API]. The postcode is sent to that service over HTTPS encryption, so it is secure during transmission. If in doubt you could avoid using a personal postcode and use something like an organisation one.
